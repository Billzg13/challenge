Coding Challenge

idea: The idea is that this program can predict a name's gender assuming you gave a correct input, and it works like this:
1.you give a name and it starts searching for the name in a Database
2.if the name doesn't exist in the DB it then makes a GET request at an API that returns the gender, afterwards we save the results
and we save it in our Database for further use
3.if the name exists in the DB it returns the gender and the process ends there


the API is https://gender-api.com/ and has a free version with 500 searches, assuming we save the results of each get in time we
won't need the API
